# Modifiers
[Git Source](https://github.com/ubiquity/ubiquity-dollar/blob/cbd28a4612a3e634eb46789c9d7030bc45955983/src/dollar/libraries/LibAppStorage.sol)

Contract includes modifiers shared across all protocol's contracts


## State Variables
### store
Shared struct used as a storage across all protocol's contracts


```solidity
AppStorage internal store;
```


## Functions
### nonReentrant

Prevents a contract from calling itself, directly or indirectly.
Calling a `nonReentrant` function from another `nonReentrant`
function is not supported. It is possible to prevent this from happening
by making the `nonReentrant` function external, and making it call a
`private` function that does the actual work.

*Works identically to OZ's nonReentrant.*

*Used to avoid state storage collision within diamond.*


```solidity
modifier nonReentrant();
```

### onlyOwner

```solidity
modifier onlyOwner();
